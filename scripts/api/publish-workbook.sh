# Publish workbook specs to Sigma — POST a new workbook, GET back the spec,
# fetch URL/metadata. Wraps the publish pipeline so callers don't compose
# eval/export/curl chains by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh post     <spec-file>
#   scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh put      <workbook-id> <spec-file>
#   scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh get-spec <workbook-id>
#   scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh get-meta <workbook-id>
#
# Auth, Accept: application/json header, and 401 auto-retry are all handled
# by the sigma_curl helper in _env.sh. Spec validation runs automatically on
# `post`/`put` (calls scripts/validate-spec.py). After a successful POST or
# PUT, audit-workbook-schema.sh runs automatically to catch formula errors
# at Sigma's DATA layer — the class of failure that verify-workbook.sh
# misses because the compiled SQL is structurally valid but references an
# errored column. Suppress the audit by setting SIGMA_SKIP_AUDIT=1.
#
# No `delete` subcommand here — deletion stays on the direct-curl path so
# it always hits the DELETE ask pattern in .claude/settings.json.

# Sigma's live POST/PUT wire format (confirmed 2026-08-04 via direct testing,
# independent of and following up on a build-mode session's report) nests
# schemaVersion/kind/pages/layout/themeOverrides/folders/agents under a
# top-level "document" key -- only name/folderId/description stay top-level
# siblings, e.g.:
#   {"name":"...", "folderId":"...", "document":{"schemaVersion":1,"kind":"workbook","pages":[...],"layout":"..."}}
# This skill's tooling (validate-spec.py, workbook-manifest.py, every example
# in examples/) authors and validates the FLAT shape (schemaVersion/pages/
# layout as top-level siblings) -- POSTing that flat shape as-is is rejected
# with a large union-type validation error naming paths like
# "0.document.0.0.0", which reads like unrelated schema drift rather than
# "wrap this in a document key". `document.kind` is REQUIRED and always
# "workbook" -- since no example or prior spec in this repo ever set a
# top-level `kind` field (it was previously response-only metadata), the
# wrap defaults it to "workbook" rather than requiring every caller to add it.
#
# Rather than push this wrapping requirement onto every caller/example/
# validator, these helpers wrap flat -> wire shape on POST/PUT and unwrap
# wire -> flat on GET, so the flat shape stays the one stable authoring
# convention everywhere else. See docs/api-notes.md -> "The document
# wrapper" for the wire shape and the verification trail.
#
# NOTE on response format: a build-mode session separately reported that
# successful POST/PUT responses come back as plain "key: value" text, not
# JSON, and patched jq-based parsing to fall back to text scanning. Verified
# 2026-08-04 that this is NOT the case via this skill's actual sigma_curl
# path -- sigma_curl already sends `Accept: application/json` (see _env.sh),
# and Sigma's API honors it for both GET and POST/PUT responses; the
# plain-text response only appears when that header is omitted (e.g. a raw
# curl call made outside sigma_curl during ad-hoc bisection). No dual-format
# response parsing was added here — the existing jq-based parsing already
# works correctly through the real script path.
