# audit-workbook-schema.sh — post-POST/PUT gate that catches formula
# errors at Sigma's DATA layer, not just at the compiled-SQL layer.
#
# Why this exists: verify-workbook.sh greps compiled SQL for markers
# like `Unknown column "..."` / `Circular column reference to [...]`.
# It MISSES the class of failure where a formula compiles into
# structurally-valid SQL but references an already-errored column, or
# uses a function / argument shape Sigma rejects at query time. In the
# schema returned by `mcp-describe workbook-element`, these columns
# show `type: error`. The UI renders them as `Reference to errored
# column "[X]"` or leaves the cell blank.
#
# Recent examples this catches (that verify-workbook.sh missed):
#   - `NTile([col], 5)` — unrecognized function, arg1 error
#   - `Percentile([<GroupedSource>/<col>], 0.2)` — cross-boundary
#     aggregation of a grouped column
#   - `Rollup(<agg>, <partition>, <non-partition-col>)` — arg3 mismatch
#   - Inline `Percentile(sibling)` mixed with per-row If on a table
#     sourcing a grouped element
#
# For each element with columns (skips controls, containers, text, and
# other non-queryable elements), this script calls `mcp-describe
# workbook-element`, parses the DDL for `error`-typed columns, and
# reports element + column + display name + formula so the failure is
# fixable without opening the workbook in the UI.
#
# Usage:  scripts/api/audit-workbook-schema.sh <workbook-id>
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no error-typed columns (a genuine clean pass)
#   1 — one or more error-typed columns detected
#   2 — setup / input error
#   3 — INCOMPLETE: one or more elements could not be checked because
#       mcp-describe.sh failed at the transport level (its own exit 3 —
#       e.g. a stale/wrong-scope token, a 403/5xx/connection failure).
#       This is deliberately NOT folded into exit 0 — a total MCP
#       outage must not read as "audit passed clean." Found via a live
#       build-mode test 2026-08-03: this exact case previously printed
#       "0 queryable element(s) checked, no error-typed columns,"
#       indistinguishable from a real clean audit of a workbook with no
#       queryable elements. Under this skill's current browser-login.sh
#       auth path, mcp-describe is expected to succeed, so hitting exit
#       3 here now is unexpected — a signal something's actually wrong
#       (stale token, real outage), not a routine/permanent condition —
#       but it's still handled the same defensive way: never folded
#       into exit 0.
#
# publish-workbook.sh invokes this automatically after POST and PUT.
# Call directly to re-audit a workbook without republishing.
