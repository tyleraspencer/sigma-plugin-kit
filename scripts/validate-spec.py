"""Pre-POST static validation for a Sigma workbook spec.

The Sigma POST/PUT endpoints accept structurally broken specs and silently
rewrite the layout — most notably, per-page `pages[].layout` fields are
discarded, container children stack into a 1/13-wide single column when not
nested in their `<GridContainer>` in the layout XML, and `format` on columns
returns a misleading "Missing 'kind' field" error when the shape is wrong.

Also catches two regression modes from the 2026-05-19 test sessions:
- Drill-passthrough collapse on viz elements (chart/KPI cols < source table cols)
- Control/column ID collision (controlId matching a column name on the filtered element)

Run before every POST/PUT:

    python3 scripts/validate-spec.py path/to/spec.json

Exits 0 on success, non-zero on any fail-level issue (one issue per line on stderr).
Warn-level issues print to stderr but do not change exit code.

    downstream via its inferred name before an explicit `name` is set. This

    hits on 3 of the 12 "canonical, non-deprecated" examples — i.e. this
    exact pattern is pervasive in workbooks that demonstrably work.

    Conclusion: either the documented rule is a phantom limitation (an
    overclaim of the same shape as the buttons/modals "unsupported" claim
    this plan retired elsewhere), or its real trigger condition is far
    narrower than "any bare-inferred passthrough column referenced

    column, and round-tripped/established workbooks are unaffected. That
    distinction isn't recoverable from the JSON alone, so this check can't

      (modals moved out of `pages[]` into a top-level `overlays` array
      2026-08-10 -- `document.pages[].type:"modal"` is no longer valid).
    - `navigate`: `target.page` matches any page `id`.
    - `select-tab`: `tabbedContainer` matches a `kind:"tabbed-container"`

# `GetPercentile` was an additional, previously-undetected fake name
# found independently while auditing this list against Sigma's own
# aggregate-functions catalog — it was never caught failing at render,
# unlike `Percentile`/`DivideSafe`, so there's no incident entry for it).
# The `*If` conditional-aggregate family was added the same day so this
# classifier still recognizes the native form after a `Sum(If(...))` →
# `SumIf(...)` rewrite (see "Conditional aggregates" in formulas.md).
#
# Also added the same day: `PercentileCont`/`PercentileDisc` explicitly.
# The bare `Percentile` alternative previously in this list never
# actually matched either of these real function names — `\bPercentile`
# matches, but the following `\s*\(` then fails against the literal
# `Cont(`/`Disc(` suffix, so the whole alternative fails and (since none
# of the other alternatives match either) the search fails outright.
# This was a real, pre-existing classifier gap independent of the
